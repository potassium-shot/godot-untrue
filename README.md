# Untrue
Untrue is a small [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) plugin that adds some game structure nodes, to swap levels, gamemodes, etc.

This repository contains a small demo project of the plugin. The plugin itself is contained in the `addons/` folder. To install it, copy the `addons/untrue` folder to the `addons/` folder of your own project.

It's not yet in the Asset Lib, as I would still like to add more things to it.
